In short sabke reason alag the but everyone was getting hurt from me.

Either I hurt them physically, mentally, torturing, bezzati, not understanding etc etc etc.

That is why, now I fear to look up to some girl in future, look to any girl, I fear talking or saying something to people.
Kal se kisi se bhi Kuch bhi baat kar ra hu, Saath mein statement khatam hone key baad bhi explain kar ra hu, normal statement mein bhi sorry bol ra hu, kahin koi zyada hurt na ho jaaye.
When I said sorry to Pooja, she said dhyaan rakhna APNA please, but again, I have tortured her also in a huge way, that is why she wants ki I should be okay and safe but do not wanted to again talk to me.

It's like, I torture people in a way that they feel, living or talking to me is equal to living in a hell. So, better remove that one person from their life and by that they make their life stress free like heaven. Even, my mom also though that way for a long time. She also did not liked talking to me and feels like ki "issue BAAT krne se accha toh Mai mar jaau ya har Baar yahi sochti this ki phone hi kaat du iska"

Divyanshi, Pooja and my Mom made me realize something very important that I was and I am a hell for all, even for My Own self. Now shiva wanted me to be trained alone till the time I become a person that everyone wanted and no one to hate of.

Now, I think, I do not have any further questions or problems with anyone, no more clarifications needed, no more blaming needed, no more answers needs to be answered. Maybe I understand all. The thing which I am not able to get, is why Mansi, but like all, she could also have her reasons, which I do not want to know now, if she tells me I will listen but not ask for it. Also, I will proactively not talk to her but also, I will not resist anyone. 

So, the reason why everyone is leaving is because of two reasons:

Everyone hates me for my tone, soch, harkatein, carelessness, misunderstood, assumptions. Also, I make people feel like hell, like a Devil. That's why the easiest way they got to know to get out of this hell is, as easy as not letting me come in their way by total exclusion of me from their lives.
The Second and main reason why everything is going on is, Shiva wants me to be trained and become a person that everyone wants and no one hates. And for that, there is a set specific time, given to me, so that I can be trained Alone with "Zero Help"
